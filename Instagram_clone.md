# Instagram Clone


## Introduction

In this project, we will be building an android application similar in spirit to instagram. We will have Phone Number Authentication feature. Users will be able to post, like and comment and also visit profiles. Later on we can also add notification, messaging and calling feature. Finally you will be able to install them on your android phones and you could also publish your apps on play store.

## Prerequisites

A good coding background is a must. A good grip over OOPS is required(preferably JAVA) but if you could manage CS101 well, you will be able to complete this project with decent efforts. All you need is lot of enthusiasm, dedication and patience(Debugging can be tiring and irritating at times).

## Procedure
### Android Studio
Note: Those who have fair knowledge of basic working of Android Studio can skip this part.

Android studio is a framework that includes every tool necessary to develop Android apps and games. Technically, it is an official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for facilitating app and game development.

Here's an article from WnCC wiki on Android App Development: [Android App Development](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Android_App_Development).
<br>Just skim through this article to get a basic overview of terms, you need not go deep; just get a rough idea.

Next, follow this tutorial to make set up Android Studio and build and install your first app: [First App: A Calculator](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Android_Studio)
<br>Congratulations! on building your first App! Do share it with us, and your friends!

### Starting with the main App

Before starting with the main project, make sure you have set up your own android device as the debugger. If your laptop does not have great processor, installing and running your apps on virtual devices would be terrible. Hence it is adviced to run your apps on your android devices. To do so, check out the developer mode in the settings of your device.<br>
[How to run your app on a real device](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app) is how you can do it. Do give it a read in case you are stuck.

An Android Application is made of various activities and fragments. Any feature or service provided by an android application is implemented by one or more of these activities.

1.) Splash Activity: <br>Android Splash Screen is the first screen visible to the user when the application’s launched. Splash screen is one of the most vital screens in the application since it’s the user’s first experience with the application.<br>
Splash screens are used to display some animations (typically of the application logo) and illustrations while some data for the next screens are fetched.

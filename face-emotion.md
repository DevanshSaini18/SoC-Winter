In this project, you will implement a CNN model from scratch using a Deep Learning library like PyTorch/Tensorflow. The model will be trained to detect facial emotions of humans via live camera feed. 

If you don't have much experience with OpenCV or CNNs, don't worry about it, we have shared links to learn some basics about them as well.

## Prequisites
- ### Python
  You'd be better off not doing this project if you don't know about Python Programming. But since you're enthusiastic, you can learn to code in Python [here](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/Python_for_Beginners).
- ### OpenCV
  Only the basics of OpenCV would be required for this project. You can learn them [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/19/opencv-tutorial-a-guide-to-learn-opencv/)
- ### Deep Learning Library(PyTorch/Tensorflow) 
  Not sure what PyTorch is? Do [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) tutorial on their website, to get to know the basics. But you need to know about Nerual Networks first. Oh here's where you can learn about NNs, just do [Week 1](https://github.com/wncc/learn-gan#week-1--getting-started) and you're good to go.
